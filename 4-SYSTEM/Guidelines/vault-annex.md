# Vault Annex — Introduction to the Middle Way conventions

The methodology guidelines (`0-VAULT-Structure.md`, `../../1-SOURCES/About Sources.md`, `../../2-RAILS/About Rails.md`, `../../3-TRANSFORMATIONS/About Transformations.md`) are **text-agnostic** — they apply to any Railroads vault built on any classical text. This annex records the conventions that are specific to *this* vault: **Introduction to the Middle Way** (དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པ).

When the Guidelines and this annex disagree on a vault-specific detail, this annex wins — **for the points it actually states**. Everything it does not state follows the defaults unchanged.

This file may be renamed for its text (`<text-slug>-annex.md`) as long as `README.md` and `4-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md` link to it.

## 1. The text

This vault serves **Introduction to the Middle Way** (*དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པ*), a Tibetan-language Madhyamaka treatise whose own colophon (`^a-1`) names its author as སློབ་དཔོན་ཟླ་བ་གྲགས་པ, studied through four Tibetan commentaries.

Source-text files in `1-SOURCES/Text/` correspond to the following books / volumes:

| Order | Book / Volume | Filename |
| ----- | ------------- | -------- |
| 1 | དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པ། (11 chapters, plus an intro and a back-matter zone) | `དབུ་མ་འཇུག་པ།.md` |

Source filenames are kept in Tibetan script, exactly as ingested. This departs from the lowercase-hyphenated naming rule in `4-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md` §4; the `registered_id` (§3) is the ASCII handle used everywhere in `2-RAILS/`.

Only books that have been ingested are present in the folder. The primary text currently being railed out is **the whole of དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པ, chapters 1–11** — at present the TOC trees of the four commentaries (`2-RAILS/Sections/Raw/toc-tree/`).

---

## 2. Addressing scheme

The root text is addressed by chapter and verse: `^chapter-verse`, with chapter numbers 1–11 and verse numbers counted from 1 inside each chapter. Two extra zones sit outside the chapters (see the registered deviation below).

**`verse_id_format`:** `chapter-verse`

**Format example:** `^6-33` (chapter 6, block 33)

### Heading hierarchy

Root text (`1-SOURCES/Text/དབུ་མ་འཇུག་པ།.md`):

| Markdown | Role | Anchor |
| -------- | ---- | ------ |
| `#` | Title of the work | `^0` |
| `##` | Intro zone (`^I-0`), chapter (`^N-0`), back-matter zone (`^a-0`) | `^I-0`, `^1-0` … `^11-0`, `^a-0` |
| `###` | Sub-heading inside a zone (`^I-1-0`, `^I-2-0`, `^a-2-0`) | `^[zone]-[n]-0` |

**The first heading of every source file — root text and commentaries — is the title of the work, written `#` and anchored `^0`** (e.g. `# ༄༅། །དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པ་ཞེས་བྱ་བ་བཞུགས་སོ། ། ^0`). This departs from `4-SYSTEM/CLAUDE.md` §5a, where the `#` title takes no block ID.

Commentaries follow the default convention in `annotation-conventions.md` §2: each `##` section carries a hand-assigned label (`^1-0`, `^I-0`, `^a-0`, …); every deeper heading takes the **full decimal path of the commentary's own TOC tree** plus the `-0` slot (for example `^3-2-1-3-2-2-3-5-0`), with no segment cap; body blocks are `^label-n`, counted from 1 inside the `##` section. A commentary's own `verse_id_format` is therefore `section-paragraph`.

### Verse numbering rule

Verse numbers restart at 1 in every chapter of the root text. Transclusion lines never take an ID and never advance a counter. Commentary body IDs restart at 1 in every `##` section.

### ⚑ Registered deviations — overrides of the default conventions

### ⚑ Intro / back-matter zones — overrides `annotation-conventions.md` §7 (registered 2026-10-13)

The default has chapters only. This vault keeps front matter and back matter addressable apart from the chapters:

- **Root text:** `^0` (title), `^I-1`–`^I-3` (Indian-language title, Tibetan title, homage to Mañjuśrī-kumārabhūta), `^a-1`–`^a-3` (author colophon, translation colophon, editorial note on the colophons). Headings `^I-0`, `^I-1-0`, `^I-2-0`, `^a-0`, `^a-2-0`.
- **Commentaries:** `^I-*` for the opening homage and pledge to compose; `^a-*` for the closing dedication and colophon. `shel-phreng` also has `^b-*` (an appendix on difficult points) and `^c-*` (the closing statement of the commentary) because its own structure has those sections.

Why: the colophons carry author, translator and edition information that metadata and rails must cite apart from any chapter.

### Re-segmentation and ID-migration log

No rail in `2-RAILS/` cites any block ID of these files yet, so none of the changes below invalidate a citation.

**2026-10-06 to 2026-10-13 — commentaries re-segmented and re-stamped (git history).** The four commentaries were re-segmented, given TOC headings and stamped with block IDs over this period; the intermediate versions I checked had no block IDs. The coworker's original imports (mostly line-per-clause) remain in git history from `8d78ebc` (2026-09-28).

**2026-10-13 — `shel-phreng` heading IDs re-nested.** The sections "གཙོ་བོར་འདོད་པ་འཐད་པའི་ཚུལ" and its two children were mis-nested in the TOC tree. The two child headings changed from `^3-2-1-1-2-2-2-3-1-1-1-1-2-2-2-2-2-1-2-2-2-1-1-0` and `…-1-2-0` to `…-2-1-0` and `…-2-2-0`. Backup: `0-INBOX/temp/fix-backups-2026-10-13/shel-phreng.source.before.md`.

**2026-10-13 — empty headings inserted.** `zab-rgyas` `^3-2-1-1-2-3-5-2-2-2-2-1-4-0` and `shel-phreng` `^3-2-1-1-2-2-2-3-1-2-2-2-1-2-1-2-0`: both nodes are announced in the text but have no passage of their own, so they are empty sections. No existing ID changed. Backups: `0-INBOX/temp/fix-backups-2026-10-13/*.before-empty-headings.md`.

**2026-10-13 — `dbu-ma-la-hjug-pa-bshad-pa` body IDs renumbered.** 13 blocks had no ID; they were stamped and the body IDs in chapters 1, 3 and 6 were renumbered so each `##` section runs 1…N with no gaps (13 added, 517 changed; headings and text unchanged). Backup: `0-INBOX/temp/fix-backups-2026-10-13/bshad-pa.source.before.md`. Any note taken before this date that cites a body ID in chapter 1 (after `^1-26`), chapter 3 (after `^3-14`) or chapter 6 (after `^6-313`) of this file must be re-checked.

**2026-10-13 — frontmatter added** to the root text and the four commentaries. Total line numbers shift by 13–17 lines; block IDs are unaffected.

**2026-10-14 — `zab-rgyas` opening given a title and an `^I` zone.** Decided with the scholar colleague: the title line became the `#` heading `^0`, and the homage, praise verses, pledge and outline statement were put under `## མཆོད་བརྗོད་དང་རྩོམ་པར་དམ་བཅའ། ^I-0` (the same heading a contributor had used on 2026-10-12). IDs changed: `^0-1` → `^0` (title heading), `^0-2`–`^0-12` → `^I-1`–`^I-11`. Text unchanged. This retires the earlier registered deviation "`zab-rgyas` opens without a title or `##` heading" (2026-10-13). Backup: `0-INBOX/temp/fix-backups-2026-10-14/zab-rgyas.before-intro-ids.md`.

**2026-10-14 — `shel-phreng` opening re-zoned.** The contributor added `## ཀླད་ཀྱི་དོན། ^I-0` under the `#` title, holding the commentary's Sanskrit title and Tibetan title as content (`^I-1`, `^I-2`; the `#` title stays as a heading copy), and relabelled the homage-and-pledge section `## འགྲེལ་བའི་མཆོད་བརྗོད་དང་རྩོམ་པར་དམ་བཅའ། ^II-0`. IDs changed: `^I-2`–`^I-6` → `^II-2`–`^II-6` (`^I-1` → `^II-1` by hand). So in `shel-phreng`, `^I-*` is the title zone and `^II-*` the homage and pledge. Backup: `0-INBOX/temp/fix-backups-2026-10-14/shel-phreng.before-intro-ids.md`.

**2026-10-14 — `shel-phreng` split word rejoined; `## ^3` body IDs renumbered.** `^3-324` held only `ག` and `^3-325` began `ཉིས་པ།` — the word `གཉིས་པ།` had been split across two blocks by a processing step (the original import `8d78ebc` has it whole). The two were rejoined as one block `^3-324` (`གཉིས་པ། འབྱུང༷་བ༷་…`), and `^3-326`–`^3-592` became `^3-325`–`^3-591` (267 IDs, contributor's choice to keep 1…N without gaps). The same pass emptied 46 lines that held only a no-break space (U+00A0) — the linter read them as text, which glued headings into body blocks. Text otherwise unchanged. Backup: `0-INBOX/temp/fix-backups-2026-10-14/shel-phreng.before-mode5-and-merge.md`.

## 3. Registered commentary IDs

Every commentary file in `1-SOURCES/Commentaries/` declares a `registered_id` in its frontmatter. That short ID is the only string used to attribute claims to the commentary throughout `2-RAILS/`.

Once assigned, a `registered_id` never changes. New commentaries must be added to the roster below before their `registered_id` is used in any rail.

| `registered_id` | Author / Title | Tier | School or tradition | `book_id` | Language | File |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---- |
| `zab-rgyas` | ཐུབ་བསྟན་དགེ་ལེགས་རྒྱ་མཚོ — དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་ཊཱི་ཀ་ཟབ་རྒྱས་ལམ་མཆོག་རབ་གསལ་སྣང་བའི་རྒྱན། | commentary (its colophon, `^4-21`, says it expands the wording of དགོངས་པ་རབ་གསལ and another work) | to be supplied | to be supplied | Tibetan | `1-SOURCES/Commentaries/དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་ཊཱི་ཀ་ཟབ་རྒྱས་ལམ་མཆོག་རབ་གསལ་སྣང་བའི་རྒྱན།.md` |
| `shel-phreng` | སི་ཏུ་པ་ཆོས་ཀྱི་རྒྱ་མཚོ (compiler, from the notes of མི་ཕམ་འཇམ་དབྱངས་རྣམ་པར་རྒྱལ་བ) — དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་འགྲེལ་བ་ཟླ་བའི་ཞལ་ལུང་དྲི་མེད་ཤེལ་ཕྲེང་། | commentary | to be supplied | to be supplied | Tibetan | `1-SOURCES/Commentaries/དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་འགྲེལ་བ་ཟླ་བའི་ཞལ་ལུང་དྲི་མེད་ཤེལ་ཕྲེང་།.md` |
| `dgongs-pa-rab-gsal` | ཤར་ཙོང་ཁ་པ་བློ་བཟང་གྲགས་པའི་དཔལ — དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་རྒྱ་ཆེར་བཤད་པ་དགོངས་པ་རབ་གསལ། | commentary | to be supplied | to be supplied | Tibetan | `1-SOURCES/Commentaries/དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་རྒྱ་ཆེར་བཤད་པ་དགོངས་པ་རབ་གསལ།.md` |
| `dbu-ma-la-hjug-pa-bshad-pa` | author not named in the file — དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་བཤད་པ། | commentary (the colophon, `^a-2`, records its translators) | to be supplied | to be supplied | Tibetan | `1-SOURCES/Commentaries/དབུ་མ་ལ་འཇུག་པའི་བཤད་པ།.md` |

"To be supplied" means the file does not state it; a human contributor fills these in. Authors above are taken from each file's own colophon, not from outside knowledge.

**Tier ordering** within a verse package's Traditional Interpretation section: not yet decided — to be set by a human contributor before the verse packages are built.

**ID migrations.** None.
